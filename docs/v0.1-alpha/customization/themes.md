# Themes
You can create themes to customize your documentation colors in a very easy way.

A theme is a CSS file stored inside `assets/css/themes` folder.

To change a theme color, edit the variables inside this file and switch to the theme by editing the `theme` setting in the [configuration file](%%version%%/getting-started/configuration).

The syntax highlighter themes are provided by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo).
