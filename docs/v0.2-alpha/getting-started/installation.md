# Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/eugabrielsilva/butterdocs/releases/latest) and unpack it to your web server.
2. Point your server to ButterDocs root directory. We'll do the rest for you.

That's all! Simple, isn't it?

### Setup your docs
You'll probably want to [configure](getting-started/configuration) your docs before getting started.

If you want to skip this step and jump straight into writing your docs, [be happy](getting-started/butter-basics).
