# Themes
You can create themes to customize your documentation colors in a very easy way.

A theme is a CSS file stored inside `assets/css/themes` folder.

To change a theme color, edit the variables inside this file, as you wish. ButterDocs will automatically switch between light and dark themes accordingly with the user setting.

The syntax highlighter themes are provided by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo) and imported into the theme files.
