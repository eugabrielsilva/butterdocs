# Assets
Your documentation assets (as the logo and favicon) are stored into `assets/images` folder.

Feel free to replace this files with your application art. You can also use this folder to store other images used in your docs, just remember to point the asset URL relatively to ButterDocs root directory, with **one upper level**. Example: `../assets/images/myfilename.png`.

If you want to use assets inside each docs version, point the asset URL relatively to the **version folder root**.
